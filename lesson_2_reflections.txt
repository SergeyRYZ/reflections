What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A folder becomes a Git repository, what allows us to track version history
using commits. A hidden .git folder is created as well to store all the
metadata.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a sort of a commit mockup. It allows us to fine tune and
preview each commit before recording it. Without it commits may contain
wrong files, comments or other mistakes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Stagin are can be compared with bot the working directory and the previous
commit. It gives us the ability to see exactly what changes are about to be
committed - which virtually eliminates a possibility of mistakes.
