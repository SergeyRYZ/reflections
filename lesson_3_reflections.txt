When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This sounds useful when working from different computers or
collaborating with others, or to showcase a project online
or simply to have a safe backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I may be working on a slightly different version of the code compared to what's in the
remote, and in any case automatic updates could create chaos if there are many
contributors and commits coming in.
